# BT: AlwaysRegenerateContracts
This is a mod for *BattleTech* that prevents the camera control from being taken away.    
Greatly speeds up turns as theres no more waiting for certain cinematics to play out, including there padding.   
Some notable removed cinematics:
- Sensor-lock skill fly-over
- Stand up
- Start up
- Melee
- Probably more...
